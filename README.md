ðŸŒ³ Forest Regeneration Prediction using Satellite Imagery

This project focuses on monitoring and predicting forest regeneration and encroachment patterns in the Dandakaranya region of Chhattisgarh, India. Using multi-year satellite data and machine learning models, we aim to support data-driven decision-making for environmental policy and conservation.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the full dataset (\~40 GB) has been uploaded externally and can be accessed (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/107v4QCFWR8yb6K4PIF4Z-uZRF9NEAHE4?usp=drive_link)
The dataset consists of:

* Multi-temporal satellite imagery (2011â€“2020)
* GRVI and other vegetation indices
* Ground-truth shapefiles (if applicable)
* PREPROCESSED DATA - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a4nogYngdtdBU_XxNMz6Jvg5Rmk2spmx?usp=drive_link
 ðŸ§  Methods Used

* QGIS for spatial analysis and preprocessing
* Python for data handling, ML modeling, and visualization
* Classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for land cover change detection
* Time-series analysis for regeneration trend prediction
ðŸŒ³ Step-by-Step in QGIS:
âœ… 1. Load Your Raster
Load each .tif image into QGIS.

Ensure it has Band 2 (Blue), Band 3 (Green), and Band 4 (Red).

âœ… 2. Calculate GRVI (Green-Red Vegetation Index)
Formula:

GRVI
=
Green
âˆ’
Red
Green
+
Red
GRVI= 
Green+Red
Greenâˆ’Red
â€‹
 
In QGIS:

Go to Raster â†’ Raster Calculator

Set output layer path.

Use expression like this:

perl
Copy
Edit
("your_image@2" - "your_image@3") / ("your_image@2" + "your_image@3")
Where:

@2 is Band 3 (Green)

@3 is Band 4 (Red)

Save result as: grvi_2015.tif, etc.

âœ… 3. Threshold GRVI to Binary Forest Map
Use the Raster Calculator again:

perl
Copy
Edit
("grvi_2015@1" > 0.1) * 1
This sets pixels with GRVI > 0.1 as 1 (forest), others as 0 (non-forest).

Save as: forest_mask_2015.tif, etc.

âœ… 4. (Optional) Clip to Shapefile AOI
Use:

Raster â†’ Extraction â†’ Clip raster by mask layer

Input raster: forest_mask_2015.tif

Mask: your AOI shapefile
 ðŸ“Š Outputs


* Regeneration classification maps
* Trend graphs over years
* Model evaluation reports (Accuracy, F1 Score, etc.)

 ðŸ“Œ Project Motivation

Indiaâ€™s forests, particularly in central tribal zones, face pressure from both human encroachment and natural degradation. Timely detection and prediction of regeneration patterns can assist policymakers and environmentalists in planning restoration initiatives.
