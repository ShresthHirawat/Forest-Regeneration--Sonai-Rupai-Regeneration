ðŸŒ³ Forest Regeneration Prediction using Satellite Imagery

This project focuses on monitoring and predicting forest regeneration and encroachment patterns in the Dandakaranya region of Chhattisgarh, India. Using multi-year satellite data and machine learning models, we aim to support data-driven decision-making for environmental policy and conservation.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the full dataset (\~40 GB) has been uploaded externally and can be accessed (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/107v4QCFWR8yb6K4PIF4Z-uZRF9NEAHE4?usp=drive_link)
The dataset consists of:

* Multi-temporal satellite imagery (2011â€“2020)
* GRVI and other vegetation indices
* Ground-truth shapefiles (if applicable)

 ðŸ§  Methods Used

* QGIS for spatial analysis and preprocessing
* Python for data handling, ML modeling, and visualization
* Classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for land cover change detection
* Time-series analysis for regeneration trend prediction

 ðŸ“Š Outputs


* Regeneration classification maps
* Trend graphs over years
* Model evaluation reports (Accuracy, F1 Score, etc.)

 ðŸ“Œ Project Motivation

Indiaâ€™s forests, particularly in central tribal zones, face pressure from both human encroachment and natural degradation. Timely detection and prediction of regeneration patterns can assist policymakers and environmentalists in planning restoration initiatives.
